Introduction:  
The internet is huge and constantly growing. Most people use search engines to find and share information, but not all search results are relevant because they come from different sources. This can make it hard, especially for beginners, to know if the results actually match what theyâ€™re looking for.  

Thatâ€™s where semantic search comes in. It helps understand the meaning behind search queries rather than just matching keywords.  

In this project, weâ€™ll use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a semantic search system for movies. This will help find the most relevant movie titles based on the actual meaning of the search query, making search results more accurate and useful.

Keyword Search vs. Semantic Search
ðŸ”¹ Keyword Search (Traditional Search)
Early search engines used keyword-based search, meaning they only looked for exact matches of the words in a query. If a webpage didnâ€™t contain the exact words you searched for, it wouldnâ€™t show upâ€”even if it was relevant. This made search results very literal and rigid, often missing useful information.

For example, searching "best action movies" would only return pages that contain all three words exactly as typed. If a page used the phrase "top action films", it might not appear in the resultsâ€”even though itâ€™s relevant!

ðŸ”¹ Semantic Search (Smarter Search)
Semantic search improves this by understanding the meaning behind words, not just the exact matches. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to identify related concepts in documents.

ðŸ’¡ How does LSI help?

It analyzes large amounts of text to understand which words often appear together.

It determines that words like "movies", "films", and "cinema" are related, so searching for one can bring results that contain the others.

It finds documents that are semantically similar, even if they donâ€™t contain the exact keywords.

ðŸ”¹ Why is This Important?
With LSI-powered search, you donâ€™t need an exact match to get good results. Unlike keyword search, semantic search can return relevant documents even if they donâ€™t contain the exact search termâ€”making it much more useful and intelligent!
